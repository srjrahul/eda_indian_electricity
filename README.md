Analysis on Indian Electricity Generation and Consumption try to find out insights and the pattern of consumption and generation of electricity.<br>
This dataset is taken from Indian govt. site https://cea.nic.in/dashboard/?lang=en# There are lot of data present on the website but I take only three dataset for analysis. You can take more data for your analysis. The three dataset are as-<br>

1. **all-india-power-generati.csv** - (data avaliable from feb-2019 to jun-2022)
2. **renewable energy generation.csv** - (data avaliable from apr-2019 to feb-2020)
3. **per-capita-consumption-k.csv** - (data avaliable from 2002-2020)

Thus, the data is taken from the website so, our first agenda is cleaning the data and try to make dataset clean for the analysis.

**Note** - `All the power units in Mega Watt(MW)`
